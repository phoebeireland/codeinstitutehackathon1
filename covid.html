            <p>We have missed you and we are delighted to welcome you back in through the doors of Code Institute Indian.
                We want to provide all of our wonderful customers with an increased level of assurance so that when you are able to dine with us, you can do so with confidence. 
                Code Institute Indian will reopen in accordance with the most updated regulations and of course, with the safety of our customers and staff as our number one priority.</p>
            <h3>You're In Safe Hands</h3>
            <p>We are take extreme responsibility to protect our staff and guest’s health, and to continue to play our part in the community effort to stop the spread of Covid-19.
                We are all in need of a little enjoyment and long overdue catch up with loved ones. We want your experience with us to be fun and relaxing, but we know that won’t happen unless you feel comfortable and safe. 
                That is why we’ve put together the ‘You’re in Safe Hands’ program, a safeguarding program based upon the best public health and government advice.</p>
            <h4>Guest Arrival</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Contactless sanitation stations have been set up at venue entrances. We require all customers to clean hands with hand sanitiser provided.</li>
                <li>Queuing – To avoid queues, our staff will use a waitlist tool that will notify guests by text message when their table is ready. Where there are queues, 
                    social distancing floor markers are in place.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Social Distancing</h4>
            <li>Code Institute Indian has been adapted to ensure the adequate social distancing requirements are met between tables. 
                Where necessary ‘table dividers’ have been installed and certain tables will be out of use.</li>
            <li>Order and pay at table technology will be made available where possible to minimise contact with physical menus and staff.</li>
            <li>Service style will be adapted in line with the best public health advise – straws available on request and will be individually wrapped, 
                garnishing reduced, minimum contact between staff and customers when delivering food & drink to the table.</li>
            <h3>Looking forward to seeing you!</h3>
